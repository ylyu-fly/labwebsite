## Team

#### Principal Investigator
**Yang Lyu, Ph.D.**

yang.lyu AT rutgers.edu

I was born and raised in Wuhan, a busy city port famous for its history, commerce, and cuisine in Central China. I left my hometown to Beijing for college and then went south to Guangzhou for graduate school. I obtained my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics from Sun Yat-sen University in 2014. To build a career abroad, I joined the laboratory of Scott Pletcher at the University of Michigan to study the neuronal modulation of aging. In September 2022, I became an Assistant Professor in the Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry at Rutgers University. 

Outside my research, I always have a good time exploring mountains and local restaurants.

Teaching: 
* Biology of Aging (694:421, Spring 2024, Spring 2025)
* Introductory Computational Biology (694:390, Spring 2025)



#### Graduate Students

**Nick Pontillo**

I received my Bachelor of Science in Behavioral Neuroscience from Northeastern University in 2019. I joined the Lyu lab at the beginning of 2023 and my project is centered on the regulation of health and longevity by nutrient choice via the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2A). I hope to use a combination of *Drosophila* genetic tools including the GAL4-UAS system and optogenetics to identify the serotonergic neuronal circuits involved in translating food choice and food perception into stress, sleep, and/or metabolic alterations that ultimately modulate longevity.

**Laura Byron**

I have been interested in science for as long as I can remember. I pursued this passion by taking classes at Cold Spring Harbor Labs in high school, and then receiving my B.A. in Genetics from Rutgers University in 2017. I spent two years as a lab technician studying aneuploidy in cancer at Columbia University before coming back to Rutgers for graduate school in the Cell and Developmental Biology program.

#### Lab Technicians

**Joel Villa (Lab Manager)** 

I am an EOF graduate and received my B.A. in Biological Sciences in 2021 from Rutgers University - New Brunswick. Throughout my life, I have always been intrigued by the brain's many mechanisms and behaviors that affect the body. I have previously researched "Asymmetric Cerebral Atrophy of the Temporal Lobe" while participating in a program at Rowan University School of Osteopathic Medicine. I joined the Lyu lab near the beginning of 2023 and hope to use the knowledge and skills from my previous experiences to contribute to this research. On my free time, I enjoy reading various genres of books but mostly true-crime novels. I also enjoy listening to music, especially Ginger Root.

#### Undergraduate Research Assistants

**Wesley Wu**

Wesley is a second year student at Rutgers University studying MBB. His hobbies include climbing and gaming.

**Advaitha Kamalakkannan**

I am a second-year undergraduate student pursuing a Molecular Biology and Biochemistry major. With prior experience in chemistry-related research, I am excited to learn about experimentation methods in a biological lab as well as understand the biology of aging and its role in the health and longevity of *Drosophila*. Outside of science, my hobbies include dancing, reading, and running– with the advent of covid, hiking has been a newfound interest of mine.

**Rajat Khurana**

Rajat Khurana is currently a Sophomore in Rutgers University. He’s currently pursuing a degree in Biology, and joined the Lyu lab in January 2023. In his free time, he's an avid enjoyer of snowboarding, having a season pass at Camelback mountain. He also enjoys the company of his friends, and occasionally plopping down in front of his TV and playing games. He’s worked with fruit flies since 2021, and is excited to see what knowledge he can uncover at his time in the Lyu Lab!

**Madison Oh**

I am a first year student pursuing a biological sciences major in the Honors College, with the hopes of attending medical school. Although I am mostly interested in the human body, I believe that studying smaller life forms like *Drosophila* will lead to better understanding of our more complex systems. In contrast to my interest in science, all my hobbies are related to art, such as drawing, watching cartoons, and recently, learning the guitar.

**Bianca Estores**

I am currently a second year undergraduate student pursuing a major in Cell Biology and Neuroscience as well as a minor in Cognitive Science. I joined the Lyu Lab in Fall 2023 with hopes of gaining research experience while learning more about cognitive behaviors and complex brain systems in smaller species such as *Drosophila* to get a better understanding of the human brain. On my free time, I enjoy doing physical activities such as lifting, climbing, and sports, as well as doing more leisurely activities such as singing, playing the guitar, gaming, and making arts.

**Selin Altunyay**

Hello! My name is Selin Altunyay! I am a First Year Rutgers Student and I am pursuing a major in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry. My ultimate career goal is to work in the medical field as a doctor. Though I am an MBB major, I am also deeply interested in Cognitive Science and Neuroscience, as well as Genetics. Outside of science, my hobbies are dancing, drawing, and playing the piano. I also really love cats, and I have a pet cat myself!

**Will Cappello**

I am a first year student in the Honors College studying Molecular Biology and Biochemistry as well as Classics. After four years of undergraduate study, I plan to enter medical school, where I hope to match into a brain-related residency. While I have always been fascinated by neurodegeneration, I gained a particular interest in aging research and, in turn, the Lyu Lab after reading Lifespan: Why We Age and Why We Don’t Have To by David Sinclair. In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer, weightlifting, hanging out with friends, reading, translating Latin, and gaming.
