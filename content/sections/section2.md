## Team

#### Principal Investigator
<span style="color: #e59f05;">**Yang Lyu, Ph.D.**</span>

yang.lyu AT rutgers.edu

I was born and raised in Wuhan, a busy city port famous for its history, commerce, and cuisine in Central China. I left my hometown to Beijing for college and then went south to Guangzhou for graduate school. I obtained my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics from Sun Yat-sen University in 2014. To build a career abroad, I joined the laboratory of Scott Pletcher at the University of Michigan to study the neuronal modulation of aging. In September 2022, I became an Assistant Professor in the Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry at Rutgers University. 

Outside my research, I always have a good time exploring mountains and local restaurants.

#### Graduate Students

<span style="color: #e59f05;">**Nick Pontillo**</span>

I received my Bachelor of Science in Behavioral Neuroscience from Northeastern University in 2019. I joined the Lyu lab at the beginning of 2023 and my project is centered on the regulation of health and longevity by nutrient choice via the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2A). I hope to use a combination of *Drosophila* genetic tools including the GAL4-UAS system and optogenetics to identify the serotonergic neuronal circuits involved in translating food choice and food perception into stress, sleep, and/or metabolic alterations that ultimately modulate longevity.

<span style="color: #e59f05;">**Laura Byron**</span>

I have been interested in science for as long as I can remember. I pursued this passion by taking classes at Cold Spring Harbor Labs in high school, and then receiving my B.A. in Genetics from Rutgers University in 2017. I spent two years as a lab technician studying aneuploidy in cancer at Columbia University before coming back to Rutgers for graduate school in the Cell and Developmental Biology program.

<span style="color: #e59f05;">**Justin Ng**</span>

Born and raised in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, I developed an early interest in aging biology through my experience as a caregiver, where I saw firsthand the emotional and financial toll of age-related diseases. This experience motivated me to pursue a career in biomedical research, earning my B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Biomedical Science in the UK before starting my Ph.D. in Cell and Developmental Biology at Rutgers University in 2024. I joined the Lyu Lab in Spring 2025, where I’m interested in how sensory perception and its associated neural pathways influence stress resistance, metabolism, and longevity in Drosophila melanogaster. Outside the lab, I enjoy teaching guitar, practicing Muay Thai, and leading science outreach projects that promote biology education and Southeast Asian representation in STEM.

#### Lab Technicians

<span style="color: #e59f05;">**Joel Villa (Lab Manager)**</span>

I am an EOF graduate and received my B.A. in Biological Sciences in 2021 from Rutgers University - New Brunswick. Throughout my life, I have always been intrigued by the brain's many mechanisms and behaviors that affect the body. I have previously researched "Asymmetric Cerebral Atrophy of the Temporal Lobe" while participating in a program at Rowan University School of Osteopathic Medicine. I joined the Lyu lab near the beginning of 2023 and hope to use the knowledge and skills from my previous experiences to contribute to this research. On my free time, I enjoy reading various genres of books but mostly true-crime novels. I also enjoy listening to music, especially Ginger Root.

<span style="color: #e59f05;">**Advaitha Kamalakkannan**</span>

I graduated from Rutgers University with a major in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry. With prior experience in chemistry-related research, I am excited to learn about experimentation methods in a biological lab as well as understand the biology of aging and its role in the health and longevity of *Drosophila*. Outside of science, my hobbies include dancing, reading, and running– with the advent of covid, hiking has been a newfound interest of mine.

<span style="color: #e59f05;">**Thara Nair**</span>

I am a Laboratory Technician with a master’s degree in Biochemistry and a bachelor’s degree in chemistry. I possess extensive experience in laboratory techniques, including specimen preparation, media preparation, and various biochemical testing methods. In March 2024, I joined Rutgers Nelson Biology's Driscoll Laboratories, where my work focuses on laboratory techniques for *C. elegans*. In March 2025, I joined Lyu Lab to assist with *Drosophila melanogaster* fly food cooking. Additionally, I have served as an IVF Laboratory Technician in India, where I was involved in media preparation and specimen analysis for reproductive technologies.

#### Undergraduate Research Assistants

<span style="color: #e59f05;">**Madison Oh**</span>

I am a third year student pursuing a biological sciences major in the Honors College, with the hopes of attending medical school. Although I am mostly interested in the human body, I believe that studying smaller life forms like *Drosophila* will lead to better understanding of our more complex systems. In contrast to my interest in science, all my hobbies are related to art, such as drawing, watching cartoons, and recently, learning the guitar.

<span style="color: #e59f05;">**Jinhu Chung**</span>

I am a second year undergraduate student studying Biomedical Engineering specializing in Tissue Engineering and Biomolecular Engineering. I joined Lyu Lab in the summer of 2024 and am excited to implement optogenetics and systems such as GAL4-UAS to assess the effects of feeding behavior and life expectancy. Outside of the lab I play for Rutgers Machine Ultimate and travel across the east coast competing against other schools.

<span style="color: #e59f05;">**Anton Misirpashayev**</span>

I joined the Lyu Lab during the spring of 2025, and I am aiming for a major in Cell Biology and Neuroscience. My goals with the lab are devoted to its research into Alzheimer's and the corresponding protein aggregates that recur and wreak havoc in the brain. My life outside of the lab can largely be summed up with playing and listening to music (usually classical and prog rock), computer gaming, language learning, and most recently, reading sci-fi novels.

<span style="color: #e59f05;">**Aditya Tripathi**</span>

I am a first year undergraduate pursuing a major in Cell Biology and Neuroscience and a double minor in Nutrition and Psychology. I joined Lyu Lab in the spring of 2025 with the hopes of learning more about how smaller Drosophila models can enhance current understanding of neurodegenerative disease progression. My hobbies outside of academics are wrestling, lifting and gaming. I am also currently learning to program!
