## Team

#### Principal Investigator
**Yang Lyu, Ph.D.**

yang.lyu AT rutgers.edu

I was born and raised in Wuhan, a busy city port famous for its history, commerce, and cuisine in Central China. I left my hometown to Beijing for college and then went south to Guangzhou for graduate school. I obtained my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics from Sun Yat-sen University in 2014. To build a career abroad, I joined the laboratory of Scott Pletcher at the University of Michigan to study the neuronal modulation of aging. In September 2022, I became an Assistant Professor in the Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry at Rutgers University. 

Outside my research, I always have a good time exploring mountains and local restaurants.

#### Graduate Student

**Nick Pontillo**
I received my Bachelor of Science in Behavioral Neuroscience from Northeastern University in 2019. I joined the Lyu lab at the beginning of 2023 and my project is centered on the regulation of health and longevity by nutrient choice via the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2A). I hope to use a combination of *Drosophila* genetic tools including the GAL4-UAS system and optogenetics to identify the serotonergic neuronal circuit/s involved in translating food choice and food perception into stress, sleep, and/or metabolic alterations that ultimately modulate longevity.

#### Undergraduate Research Assistants

**Tim Qi**
I am a Senior undergraduate student majoring in Biochemistry. I am most interested in learning about biological processes and understanding their mechanisms through research. In my free time I enjoy playing games, reading, and traveling.

**Wesley Wu**
Wesley is a second year student at Rutgers University studying MBB. His hobbies include climbing and gaming.

**Advaitha Kamalakkannan**
I am a second-year undergraduate student pursuing a Molecular Biology and Biochemistry major. With prior experience in chemistry-related research, I am excited to learn about experimentation methods in a biological lab as well as understand the biology of aging and its role in the health and longevity of *Drosophila*. Outside of science, my hobbies include dancing, reading, and running– with the advent of covid, hiking has been a newfound interest of mine.

**Rajat Khurana**
Rajat Khurana is currently a Sophomore in Rutgers University. He’s currently pursuing a degree in Biology, and joined the Lyu lab in January 2023. In his free time, he's an avid enjoyer of snowboarding, having a season pass at Camelback mountain. He also enjoys the company of his friends, and occasionally plopping down in front of his TV and playing games. He’s worked with fruit flies since 2021, and is excited to see what knowledge he can uncover at his time in the Lyu Lab!

**Madison Oh**
I am a first year student pursuing a biological sciences major in the Honors College, with the hopes of attending medical school. Although I am mostly interested in the human body, I believe that studying smaller life forms like *Drosophila* will lead to better understanding of our more complex systems. In contrast to my interest in science, all my hobbies are related to art, such as drawing, watching cartoons, and recently, learning the guitar.
