## Join Us

Our laboratory is located in the [Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry](https://mbb.rutgers.edu/) at [Rutgers](https://www.rutgers.edu/), the State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick (Busch Campus). The campus is located within one hour of New York City and Philadelphia.

We are committed to building an intellectual, diverse, collaborative, and inclusive environment in our lab. If you are interested in our research and enthusiastic about joining us, please reach out to me through the email link below.

For prospective graduate students: Depending on funding availability, we may recruit students from the [CDB](https://molbiosci.rutgers.edu/cdb) and [neuroscience](https://grad.rutgers.edu/academics/graduate-programs/neuroscience) programs at Rutgers. Feel free to contact me to inquire about rotating in our lab.
