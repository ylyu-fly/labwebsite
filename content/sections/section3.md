## Join Us

Our laboratory is located in the [Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry](https://mbb.rutgers.edu/) at [Rutgers](https://www.rutgers.edu/), the State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick (Busch Campus). The campus is located within one hour of New York City and Philadelphia.

We are actively looking for talented researchers – from PhDs to undergraduate students – to join our team. We are committed to building an intellectual, diverse, collaborative, and inclusive environment in our lab. If you are interested in our research and enthusiastic about joining us, please reach out to me: yang.lyu AT rutgers.edu.

For prospective graduate students: we are currently recruiting students from the [CDB](https://molbiosci.rutgers.edu/cdb) and [neuroscience](https://grad.rutgers.edu/academics/graduate-programs/neuroscience) programs at Rutgers – contact me or your program to rotate in our lab.
