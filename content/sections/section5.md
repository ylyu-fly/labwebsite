## Lab News

**Summer, 2023**

This summer marked the inaugural Lyu Lab Flympics - an event already destined to become a time-honored tradition! In a display of *Drosophila* prowess, Laura emerged as the esteemed Flympics Champion, while Madison secured the promising title of Future Fly Star. The spirit of our Jersey roots was alive as we played music from the legendary Bon Jovi to commemorate these achievements and the initiation of this exciting new tradition in the Lyu Lab.

Madison presented her research project titled "Protein Perception Modulates Lifespan and Reproduction in Drosophila" to RU students and professors alike at the DLS-SURF Research Symposium.  

**Spring, 2023** 

Madison was awarded the [DLS Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship](https://biology.rutgers.edu/biological-sciences/fellowships-and-awards/dls-surf)!! CONGRATULATIONS Madison!
